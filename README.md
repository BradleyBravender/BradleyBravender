## About Me

🔬 In elementary school I would strip the plastic off of metal bread-bag twist ties to use as wires in circuits I'd make from salvaged circuit board components. Now, **I'm a computer engineering student** at the University of Alberta. 

🌍 After I graduated high school, I moved to **Zambia, Africa** for 18 months. It opened my eyes to the impact certain technologies have on our quality of life. 

🧠 Now, I'm dedicated to developing my abilities in artificial intelligence, automation, and computer vision because I believe in the potential that these technologies have in drastically increasing transportation safety and efficiency, food production, and affordability of tools and resources provided at a lower cost through automation.

## Experience

🤖 This past summer term, I was awarded the competitive NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award to conduct research in the University of Alberta's Mechatronic Systems Lab.

💻 During my research term, I furthered my proficiency in Python, learned the fundamentals of C++ and Robot Operating System (ROS), and worked with robotics hardware (peripherals like Nvidia Jetsons, Velodyne VLP16 Lidars, Novatel GPS, etc) to perform SLAM on a Clearpath Jackal platform. I also shadowed masters students employing artificial intelligence and computer vision in UAVs applications.

🚁 I've recently joined the imaging team in the University of Alberta Aerial Robotics Group (UAARG) to improve the ground base recognition process. Stay tuned!

👁️‍🗨️ I'm currently looking for a SWE internship for the May - August 2024 term in the field of self-driving or unmanned air vehicles. 👁️‍🗨️
