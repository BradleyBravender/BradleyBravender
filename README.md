## About Me

🔬 In elementary school, I would build circuits using salvaged components and bread-bag twist ties as my wires!

🌍 After high school, I volunteered in Zambia, where I saw firsthand how access to technology can significantly improve quality of life.

🧠 I’m passionate about using autonomous vehicles, computer vision, and embedded systems to make a positive impact on the world.

## Experience

🤖 In the spring of 2023, I was awarded the competitive NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award to conduct robotics research at the University of Alberta's Mechatronic Systems Lab.

🚁 That fall, I co-founded Engineers Without Borders UAlberta and contributed to the University of Alberta Aerial Robotics Group (UAARG) as part of the computer vision team, improving drone object detection algorithms.

🪖 During the summer of 2024, I worked as a Robotics Development Intern at Defense Research and Development Canada, helping to bring sight to an autonomous vehicle.

👀 And now? I’m currently looking for an exciting SWE or HWE internship for the January - April 2025 term! 🚨
