## About Me

I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Alberta! After I graduated high school, I moved to Zambia, Africa for 18 months as a volunteer. It opened my eyes to the impact certain technologies have on our quality of life. I'm passionate about artificial intelligence, automation, and computer vision, and believe that these technologies will create a world of difference in our road safety, our food production, and our ability to access tools made avaialable at a lower cost via automation.
