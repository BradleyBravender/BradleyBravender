## About Me

I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Alberta. 

After I graduated high school, I moved to Zambia, Africa for 18 months as a volunteer. That experience opened my eyes to the impact certain technologies have on our quality of life. I'm passionate about artificial intelligence, automation, and computer vision, and believe that these technologies will create a world of difference by drastically increasing transportation safety and efficiency, food production, and affordability of tools and resources provided at a lower cost through automation.
